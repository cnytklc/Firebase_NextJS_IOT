This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Project acronym: Firebase IoT

# Project aims

The Firebase IoT project aims to send ambient temperature and humidity data to Firebase
Realtime Database using ESP8266 NodeMCU and DHT11 sensor and display these data in real
time on NextJS web page and Android mobile application with MIT App Inventor. Users can
remotely monitor temperature and humidity and access data on different platforms.

# Ethics and standards

Firebase IoT prioritizes ethical considerations by ensuring the privacy and security of user data.
Data transmission and storage adhere to industry-standard encryption protocols to prevent
unauthorized access. Additionally, the project complies with relevant data protection
regulations to safeguard user privacy.

# Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)

The Firebase IoT project is related to the 11th Sustainable city and living spaces. The project
can help users optimize energy consumption and create a more sustainable environment in
their home or workplace. Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring can contribute to
energy savings by enabling more efficient use of heating and cooling systems. Additional Notes:
The project can be used in different areas such as home automation, agriculture and
greenhouse applications.
